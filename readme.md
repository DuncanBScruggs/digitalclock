# Digital Clock Project

repo/
    index.html - main page
    css/ - folder to contain CSS files
        style.css - main stylesheet
    img/ - folder to contain any images
    js/ - folder to contain JavaScript files
        main.js - main JavaScript file
    README.md - any important information
    .gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked

##    Requirements
To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

    1. Display the current time (Hour:Minute:Second AM/PM) as a digital clock format
    2.Make sure it updates every second without refreshing the page

##    Additional Requirements
        - Website must be responsive
        - Website must be styled
        - Use the tools and technologies covered in class to complete your website. To see what we have covered, check the Class Resources Repo.
        - Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.
        - Remember to push to GitHub!
        - Potential employers will view your GitHub profile, so activity is crucial!

##    Stretch Goals
        - Change the font for the display; a mono-spaced font would look more like a digital clock, and it wouldn't jar your eyes as the variable-width string is re-centered every second.
        - Add the date (day, month, and year)
        - Make a button for toggling between a 12-hour and a 24-hour display
        - Turn it into an ANALOG clock!

##    If you finish early
        - Continue to add your own content, additions, and pages to your site and improve the styling.
        - Add info to your projects README.md README.md Best Practices
        - Share links and resources from this week to the Help slack channel.
